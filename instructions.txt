Instructions for Local Server setup on Windows10
(if using XAMPP - use version : 5.6.37 / PHP 5.6.37 @ https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html)
(IOS users; sorry, you are on your own)

clone the repo
Create your Google API service account and download the credentials file
(steps 1-7 @ https://www.fillup.io/post/read-and-write-google-sheets-from-php/)
(In addition to enabling Google Sheets API, you should enable Google Drive API)
  Rename it to credentials.json
Place the credentials.json file into "resources\php_libraries\Google_Sheets_API\credentials\"
Open a cmd/terminal and traverse to the project folder ("C:/xampp/htdocs/Google_SheetsML" for me)
Install Composer and NPM :
Composer : https://getcomposer.org/download/
npm : https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm
  Run "composer update"
  Run "npm install"

Rename .env.example in the root directory to .env and fill in local info

Edit the httpd-vhost.conf file of your xampp at : path_to_xampp\apache\conf\extra\
Add this to the file (unless you already have a server linked to localhost):
  <VirtualHost *:80>
  	ServerName localhost
  	DocumentRoot "C:/xampp/htdocs/Google_SheetsML/public"
  </VirtualHost>
Change the path to reflect your file system.

If you have another server on localhost, you will need to register it under a different name,
and add a link to it in the hosts file (C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\)
Example:
127.0.0.1	localhost
127.0.0.1	servername.test

Open your Xampp Control Panel -> Start the Apache and MySQL module
Open a cmd/terminal and traverse to the project folder ("C:/xampp/htdocs/Google_SheetsML" for me)
  Run "npm run watch"
  This will compile the css and js of the project and autorecompile any changes made
  (cmd/terminal must remain open for npm run watch to continue running)

Now just open up your browser and go to the servername you registed (for me its just localhost)

Note: Running multiple projects in Xampp (atleast multiple Laravel projects) may
  cause some caching issues. I had an issue where project 'A' used files from project 'B''s folders
  A full reinstall fixed it, but disabling cache and all the other solutions that
  I found, did not work for me
