clone the repo
Create your Google API service account and the the credentials file
  Rename it to credentials.json
Place the credentials.json file into resources\php_libraries\Google_Sheets_API\credentials\
Open a cmd/terminal and traverse to the project folder ("C:/xampp/htdocs/Google_SheetsML" for me)
  Run "composer update"
  Run "npm install"

Edit the httpd-vhost.conf file of your xampp at : path_to_xampp\apache\conf\extra\
Add this to the file (unless you already have a server linked to localhost):
  <VirtualHost *:80>
  	ServerName localhost
  	DocumentRoot "C:/xampp/htdocs/Google_SheetsML/public"
  </VirtualHost>
Change the path to reflect your file system.

If you have another server on localhost, you will need to register it under a different name, and
add a link to it in the hosts file (C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\)
Example:
127.0.0.1	localhost
127.0.0.1	servername.test

Open your Xampp Control Panel -> Start the Apache and MySQL module
Open a cmd/terminal and traverse to the project folder ("C:/xampp/htdocs/Google_SheetsML" for me)
  Run "npm run watch"
  This will compile the css and js of the project and autorecomile any changes made
  (cmd/terminal must remain open for npm run watch to continue running)

Now just open up your browser and go to the servername you registed (for me its just localhost)
